 # HOME-AUTOMATION-SYSTEM
 As we know the present day home systems are not automated, that is they have to be controlled manually using physical switches. On individual level it is time consuming and leads to unnecessary power wastage. This makes monitoring of appliances very much important. Other than this there are various challenges like maintenance, security, connectivity, physical presence etc. By overcoming these obstacles, we can create an environment where users can effortlessly control and manage their smart devices, leading to increased adoption and a more satisfying home automation experience.

So the problem proposed was to design and implement a “Home Automation System” using Microcontrollers so that there can be automation in home appliances also. The suggested microcontrollers were Node MCU and arduino and the automation had to be controlled using third party website or app.

The objectives needed to be achieved were as follows:

•	Energy Efficient Systems
•	Increased Convenience
 • Remote Access 
•	Automated Control 
•	Better Security
